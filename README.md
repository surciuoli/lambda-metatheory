# Meta-theory of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

This project contains a framwork for the pure lambda calculus. Subsitution is based on Stoughton's approach of multiple substitutinos.

On top of the framework, two proofs of the Strong Normalization Theorem for the simply-typed lambda calculus are given. One proof is due to the method of Joachimski and Matthes, and the other is based on the method of logical relations by Girard.
