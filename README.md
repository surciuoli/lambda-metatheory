# Lambda-calculus Meta-theory

This project contains two different proofs of the Strong Normalization Theorem for the simply-typed lambda-calculus.

One proof is due to the method of Joachimski and Matthes, and the other is based on the traditional method of logical relations (reducible functions) by Girard.
